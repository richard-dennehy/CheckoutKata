# Checkout Kata

To run tests: _sbt test_

Potential future enhancements
-
- Create a user interface for the checkout
- As part of UI work, create a helper class to convert arbitrary user input into an Item, and handle invalid input.
- Move the currency formatter out of the checkout class itself, and into the helper class
- More flexible special offers, e.g. "Spend £X, get £Y off"
